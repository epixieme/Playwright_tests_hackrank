I want to be part of QA Wolf as I share the same vision  about collaboration and I want to 
be part of a team that proves people can work cohesively internationally and remotely.
I like the idea of working with multiple clients across industries and that each project will be 
different ensuring my working day will always be interesting and with plenty of problems to solve.
As a person with a problem solving background in QA and software engineering I feel that this is something
I would be well suited to and hopefully I will excel at.
