I want to be part of QA Wolf as I share the same vision about collaboration and I want to be part of a team that proves people 
can work cohesively internationally and remotely.

I have always worked in customer-focused environments eg I worked for PWC and OFGEM which were both customer-focused and team-based roles 
and I like the idea of working with multiple clients across industries and that each project will be different ensuring my working day will 
always be interesting and with plenty of problems to solve.

When I worked for PWC the role involved working on multiple BI platforms and bespoke systems so I had to be highly organised 
and prepared to switch projects at any given time, depending on priority. So I am used to the unexpected.

Also as a person with a problem-solving background in manual testing and more recently in software engineering, 
I think this combination already makes me highly suitable for the role. 

I am used to working in environments where we help each other out and get things done.

Finally, I think I am a friendly enthusiastic person to work with and someone who would lend a hand, 
QA Wolf sounds like that kind of team after reading the reviews on Glassdoor so it would be an environment I would be enthusiastic to work with.
